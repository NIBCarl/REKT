# Responsive Layout Implementation

## Task 8: Implement responsive layout and grid system

This document summarizes the responsive layout and grid system implementation for the RektonomicsSection component.

## Implementation Details

### CSS Grid Layout
- **Desktop (1024px+)**: Three-column layout with `grid-template-columns: 1fr auto 1fr`
- **Tablet (768px-1023px)**: Adjusted three-column layout with `grid-template-columns: 1fr 200px 1fr`
- **Mobile (767px and below)**: Single-column stacked layout with `grid-template-columns: 1fr`

### Grid Areas
```css
grid-template-areas: 
  "distribution mascot chart"  /* Desktop/Tablet */
  
/* Mobile stacking order: */
grid-template-areas: 
  "mascot"
  "distribution"
  "chart"
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Large Desktop**: 1440px+ (enhanced spacing and larger containers)
- **Desktop**: 1024px-1439px (standard three-column layout)
- **Tablet**: 768px-1023px (compressed three-column layout)
- **Mobile**: 481px-767px (single-column stacked layout)
- **Small Mobile**: 480px and below (optimized for small screens)

### CSS Custom Properties
Implemented consistent spacing system using CSS custom properties:
```css
--spacing-small: 8px;
--spacing-medium: 16px;
--spacing-large: 24px;
--spacing-xlarge: 32px;
--spacing-xxlarge: 40px;
--spacing-xxxlarge: 48px;
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Responsive Typography
- Uses `clamp()` function for fluid typography scaling
- Different font sizes for each breakpoint
- Maintains readability across all screen sizes

#### 2. Container Constraints
- Maximum width constraints for optimal reading experience
- Responsive padding that adapts to screen size
- Proper aspect ratio maintenance for all components

#### 3. Grid Item Behavior
- **Distribution Breakdown**: Left-aligned on desktop, centered on mobile
- **Mascot Center**: Always centered, maintains aspect ratio
- **Pie Chart**: Right-aligned on desktop, centered on mobile

#### 4. Accessibility Features
- Focus management for keyboard navigation
- Support for `prefers-reduced-motion`
- High contrast mode support
- Screen reader friendly structure

#### 5. Performance Optimizations
- Container queries for better responsive control
- Efficient CSS Grid implementation
- Minimal layout shifts during responsive changes

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers with CSS Grid support
- Fallback behavior for older browsers
- Progressive enhancement approach

### Testing Considerations
- Layout integrity across all breakpoints
- Component spacing and alignment
- Typography scaling and readability
- Interactive element accessibility

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **6.1**: Mobile devices adapt layout to stack elements vertically while maintaining visual hierarchy
✅ **6.2**: All assets scale appropriately without losing quality across screen sizes  
✅ **6.3**: Tablet sizes maintain general layout structure with appropriate spacing adjustments
✅ **6.4**: Text remains readable and interactive elements remain accessible at all breakpoints
