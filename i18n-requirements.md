# Multilingual Functionality Requirements

## Overview
Implement comprehensive multilingual support for the REKT website using next-intl, enabling users to switch between languages while maintaining the futuristic aesthetic and user experience of the site.

## Objectives
- Support multiple languages (English, Spanish, French, Japanese) initially, with easy expansion capability
- Implement language detection based on browser settings
- Allow users to manually switch languages via a language selector in the navigation bar
- Ensure all text content throughout the site is translatable
- Maintain SEO benefits with locale-specific URLs
- Preserve the current design aesthetic across all languages

## Technical Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Implement next-intl for internationalization support
- Create a middleware for locale detection and routing
- Restructure the app directory to support locale-based routing
- Develop a language switcher component in the navigation bar
- Extract all hardcoded text into translation files

### Supported Languages (Initial Phase)
- English (en) - Default
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- Japanese (ja)

### Key Components to Internationalize
- Navigation links and mobile menu
- Hero section content
- Tokenomics section labels and descriptions
- Loss Claim page content
- Staking page content
- Leaderboard section headers and content
- Team section titles and descriptions
- Roadmap section phase titles and milestone text
- Whitepaper section content
- FAQ section questions and answers
- Footer links and copyright text

### User Experience Requirements
- Language selection should be persistent across sessions
- Language switcher should clearly indicate the current language
- Switching languages should not disrupt the user's current location in the site
- Loading new language resources should not significantly impact performance

### SEO Requirements
- Implement locale-specific URLs (e.g., /es/staking, /fr/loss-claim)
- Include appropriate HTML lang attributes
- Support hreflang tags for language alternatives
- Ensure metadata (title, description) is translated for each page

### Accessibility Requirements
- Language selector should be keyboard accessible
- Language options should include both language code and native name
- Proper aria attributes for the language selector

## Implementation Constraints
- Maintain compatibility with Next.js 15 and React 19
- Ensure the solution works with the App Router architecture
- Minimize bundle size impact
- Avoid disrupting existing functionality
- Maintain the cyberpunk/futuristic aesthetic across all languages

## Future Considerations
- Support for right-to-left (RTL) languages
- Content length variations across languages (UI must accommodate)
- Potential integration with a translation management system
- Automated translation workflow for content updates
